# ⚛️ React Stunk

Stunk integrates effortlessly with React through the `useChunk` hook, enabling components to reactively read and update state from a Chunk.

### Why use `useChunk`?

✅ Reactive & Efficient – Automatically updates components when state changes.  
✅ Optimized Rendering – Supports selectors to prevent unnecessary re-renders.  
✅ Simple & Flexible – Works with primitive values, objects, and async state.

## Installation

Install `stunk` if you have not.

```bash
# npm
npm install stunk

# yarn
yarn add stunk

# pnpm
pnpm install stunk

# bun
bun add stunk
```

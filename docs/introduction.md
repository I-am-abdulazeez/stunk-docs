# Introduction

**Stunk** is a lightweight, framework-agnostic state management library built on atomic state principles. It simplifies state management by breaking state into **manageable "chunks"**, ensuring efficient updates and reactivity.

## What is Stunk?

Stunkâ€”a playful blend of **"state"** and **"chunk"**â€”is designed to be a **fast, flexible, and reactive** state management solution for **TypeScript and JavaScript** applications. It embraces atomic state management while offering advanced features like **middleware, time travel, and async state handling**.

## **Why Stunk?**

Imagine your application's state as a **large jar**. Instead of storing everything in one messy container, Stunk lets you **divide it into smaller, well-organized chunks**. These **chunks** hold individual pieces of state, making them easy to **update, access, and subscribe to**. When a chunk changes, only the necessary parts of your application updateâ€”**boosting performance and efficiency**.

ðŸš€ **Key Benefits:**  
âœ… **Lightweight & Fast** â€“ Minimal overhead, no dependencies.  
âœ… **Fine-Grained Reactivity** â€“ Automatic updates for subscribed chunks.  
âœ… **Batch Updates** â€“ Group updates, notify once.  
âœ… **Async-Ready** â€“ Built-in support for loading and error states.  
âœ… **Middleware Support** â€“ Extend functionality with custom logic.  
âœ… **Time Travel Debugging** â€“ Easily undo and redo state changes.

With Stunk, **state management is no longer a hassleâ€”itâ€™s effortless, scalable, and intuitive.**
